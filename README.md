# HW1_DataAnalysis

Digging into Chicago Data Sets for 311 requests for tree trims and tree debris.

Here in my repository I tried to analyse datasets for 311 request tree trims and tree debris to find out:

1. Total requests made for tree trims.
2. Total requests made for tree debris.
3. Checking tree trim requests made at particular Zipcode provided by the user.
4. Similarly Checking tree Debris requests made at particular Zipcode provided by the user.
5. I figured that lots of requests are made to 311 and there is no record for completing those requests for many of them.
